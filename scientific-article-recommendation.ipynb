    "The ultimate goal of this project will be to establish which articles a user should read based off of the content similarity of the abstract to other documents. The abstract is chosen, rather than the title of the paper, because it provides a more rich context for assessing what the paper will be about. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF vectorizations provide a fast and easy-to-tune representation of the dataset that doesn't require a knowledge of model training to create a representation of the document. This out-of-the-box functionality makes it a great first pick for applying a vectorization method to text (Further descriptions of TF-IDF are included in the analysis section with TF-IDF). The TF-IDF vectorizations do a generally good job of identifying similar papers, with the antecedent paper's abstract describing an analysis of \"the formation of hot subdwarf stars\" being most closely linked to a paper on \"A review... [of] the properties, origin and evolutionary links of hot subluminous stars\". Both papers belong to the ground-truth category of astrophysics, indicating that the recommendation based on TF-IDF document similarity is relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doc2Vec implements a more sophisticated approach towards developing word embeddings of documents as an extension to Word2Vec, which represents words. Doc2Vec is utilized below to identify a vectorized representation of the abstracts in the paper, which is then compared with the vectorization of the other abstracts in the dataset. This is much the same principle applied to TF-IDF, but with an emphasis on developing better representations of the text to form more intelligent recommendations. The model is trained by tokenizing the corpus of documents in the dataset, and training for 10 epochs wherein the learning rate is gradually decreased. This training approach could be extended to cover a broader feature space given additional available computation and time, but this serves as a useful introduction to the usage of Doc2Vec. The model then generates vectors of length 100 to represent the abstracts. intended to be a compression of the larger 124-token average word length of the abstracts in the corpus. Doc2Vec recommends another paper from astrophysics as being the most relevant results - but as this approach involves a relatively naive training approach to article similarity, this recommendation could likely be improved still further by additional training and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document Clustering here entails the application of dimensionality reduction with PCA to the TF-IDF matrix and applying the elbox method with K-Means to get an initial sense of the proper number of clusters to assign to the matrix, we retrieve cluster labels for all the articles and plot the labeled clusters with the document abstract embeddings with T-SNE. This gives us the overall effect of seeing which documents are most closely associated with other documents in a visual sense - a big point to keep mind, however, is that this representation has been doctored up to fit in a lower-dimensional space and that we cannot truly \"see\" the similarity of these documents. The document clusterings are then used to return the cluster that most prominently includes the category of the paper that is being read, so if we have an Astrophysics paper, the approach below will recommend all of the papers from the cluster of documents that most prominently features the category of the paper you are reading (Astrophysics).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trade-Offs - Pros & Cons by Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "* TF-IDF is quick and easy to understand, but may not capture the optimal similarity of abstracts due to a lack of context built into the representation of the corpus\n",
    "* Doc2Vec is capable of achieving high performance and can be further tuned for greater accuracy but requires additional time & memory to train model\n",
    "* Document clustering returns a series of relevant articles for a given article in question (like typical search results) but does not rank the relevance of the results to orient the reader to the next-best paper as the prior approaches do. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* An implementation of similarity *after* constructing document clusterings may be helpful for a full-service engine, however, this is beyond the scope of this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations & Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "The limitations of this approach are detailed throughout, but are described at a high level below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* TF-IDF embeddings are done on the initial corpus, with no additional N-Gram representations or further preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "* Doc2Vec model is trained with baseline set of parameters and for a short amount of epochs\n",
    "\n",
    "* Document clusterings may misrepresent the visualization of document clusterings due to dimensionality reduction (visualization is pleasing for its own sake - rather than for prediction/inference)\n",

    "# Implenting TF-IDF Vectorization for Document Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "[TF-IDF](https://www.capitalone.com/tech/machine-learning/understanding-tf-idf/) is a way to represent text that offers typically better performance than a Bag-of-Words representation. TF-IDF refers to Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency, which refers to the way in which the importance/relevance of strings is determined. The goal is to get a sense of what words are relevant based on their frequency both within the document and across the corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF vectorization works based on two metrics, based on the name:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Term Frequecy - what is the frequency of a term? Term frequency can be defined multiple ways, including the number of appearances, of the frequency as a proportion of the words in the corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Inverse Document Frequency - what is the frequency of a word throughout the corpus? This figure is calculated by looking at number of documents divided by the number of documents that the term appears in.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then multiply the term frequency by the inverse document foodage to get the TF-IDF score. The higher the score, the more relevant the term is. As a term gets less relevant, its TF-IDF score approaches 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[Sci-Kit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html) includes an implementation of TF-IDF vectorization that can be applied out of the box, we'll apply it here to the corpus (the first 10000 articles) to get the word representations for our initial approach.

    "## Doc2Vec Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "[Doc2Vec](https://pub.towardsai.net/an-intuitive-introduction-of-document-vector-doc2vec-42c6205ca5a2) is an extension of Word2Vec focused on representing Documents (rather than individual words) as vectors. This is helpful for processing and comparing the similarity of our abstracts because we can generate a more *dense* representation of the vectors in the text, which could help us to assign more accurate similarity for longer text documents. The Doc2Vec model is applied via the implementation by [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/doc2vec.html) - a strong library for word vectorizations.The model uses either hierarchical softmax or negative sampling, and allows us to infer responses from inputs with simple call functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model that we implement here has several parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* documents=None - the input corpus. This could be a list of elements, but for larger document sets, consider using some iterable approach towrads streaming the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Alpha - the initial learning rate\n",
    "\n",
    "* Min-Alpha: learning rate will drop to min alpha as training progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* corpus_file=None - A path to a file containing the corpus. Use this argument instead of documents for a performance boost.\n",
    "\n",
    "* vector_size=100 - Dimensionality of the feature vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* dm_mean=None - If 0, uses the sum of the context word vectors, if 1 uses the mean. Only applyed when used on non-concatenative mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "* dm=1 - defining the training algorithm. If dm=1 (default), then we use distributed memory, otherwise employing distributed bag of words instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "* dbow_words=0d - If 1, word vectors are trained in skim gram fashion simultaneously with DBOW doc-vector training. If 0 then only trains doc-vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "* dm_concat=0 - expected constant number of document tages per document when using dm_concat mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "* dm_tag_count=1 - Expected constant number of document tags per document, when using dm_concat mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "* dv=None - contains the paragraph vectors learned from the training data. One such vector for each unique documen ttag.\n",
    "\n",
    "* trim_rule=None - vocabulary trimming - specifies whether certain words should remain the vocabulary, be trimmed away, or handled with default. Can be non (min_count used) or a callable accepting parameters (word, count, min_count) and returns the rule. If given, the rule is only used to prune vocabulary during current method calls and isn't stored in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* callbacks=() - list of callbacks to be executed/run during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "* window=5 - the maximum distance between the current and the predicted word within a sentnse.\n",
    "\n",
    "* epochs=10 - the number of iterations over the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "* shrink_windows=True - if true, effective window is uniformly sampled for each target word during raining - matching the original word2vec algorithm's approximate weighting of context words by distance. otherwise, the effective window is always fixed to window words to either side.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main parameters that we'll keep an eye on are the vector size, the epochs, the window, the alpha, and the count. [Alpha](https://machinelearningmastery.com/understand-the-dynamics-of-learning-rate-on-deep-learning-neural-networks/) is used to determine how heavily errors are penalized during model training - it is often desirable to start with a larger alpha value to make a lot of progress early in training, then reduce the learning rate as training proceeds in order to stabilize model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm for Doc2Vec is explained in more depth [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4053.pdf) and is introduced on IMDB sentiment analysis [here](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/blob/3c3506d51a2caf6b890de3b1b32a8b85f7566ca5/docs/notebooks/doc2vec-IMDB.ipynb), the main idea that we want to get at in this project is to get a more informative representation of article abstracts, we'll stick with a minimally modified approach for now."

    "The results from the Doc2Vec model are strong - it returns another astrophysics abstract, but interestingly enough doesn't include a large set of shared words. This appears to be an article that talks about binary star systems, but doesn't mention the word star in it - the ability of the model to discover this relationship is interesting, though whether or not it actually posseses a high degree of relevance may be a question better suited to somebody with genuine subject matter expertise.\n",

    "\n",
    "Another approach to getting similar items from a dataset is clustering - typically only applied to numeric values. Here we'll utilize a basic [K-Means](https://dataminingbook.info/book_html/chap13/book.html) approach to getting similar documents from the corpus by applying K-Means to the TF-IDF matrix values. \n",

    "\n",
    "For a moment, conceive of the dataset as a hypersphere in N dimensions (you won't be able to picture a 100 dimensional object, but try to think about the data geometrically rather than tabularly). In K-Means, the algorithm will look at the distance from each point in the dataset to each centroid using Euclidean Distance. As the number of dimensions increases, more and more of the proportion of data in the dataset will shift away from the center of this hypersphere (where it is \"close\" to other points) and shift towards the shell of the hypersphere - introducing an artificially inflated sense of distance from the other points.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that in high-dimensional spaces, K-Means will have difficulty identifying groups, therefore, we'll apply dimensionality reduction to the dataset prior to getting our document clusters, and compare the results to when we kept the original matrix."

    "Next we'll use [SkLearn's](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html) implementation of T-SNE to generate a manifold of the tfidf matrix in a lower dimension. T-SNE stands for [T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/manifold.html#t-sne), and is used to visualize high-dimensional data. The approach converts the similarity of points into joint probabilites - minimizing the [divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) of the join probabilities in the high-dimensional data vs. the low dimensional data via gradient descent. SkLearn recommends that dimensionality reduction be applied prior to use in order to suppress noise and improve computational speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5 parameters to control with t-SNE, they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Perplexity - the entropy of the conditional probability distribution. Larger perplexities mean more neighbors are considered and the manifold will be less sensitive to small structural changes. Lower perplexity conversely related to smaller neighbors, ignoring more of the global information. Larger perplexities are often required in larger dataset to get a reasonable sample of the neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) early exaggeration factor - joint probabilities are artificially increased by multiplication during early training, this reults in larger gaps between natural clusters of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) learning rate - Values that are too low cause Gradient Descent to stagnate. Heuristic is to set the value to the sample size divided by the early exaggeration factor. Set with learning_rate='auto'.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) maximum iteractions number - generally high enough to not require tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) angle - not applied in method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An important thing to keep in mind is that the visualizations generated are not a ground-truth assessment of the feature space, they are only an avenue towards seeing the behavior of the data in high dimensions. Read more about t-SNE [here](https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/).\n",

Common envelope ejection is the most probable formation\\nchannel. Among these, eclipsing systems are of special importance because it is\\npossible to constrain the parameters of both components tightly by combining\\nspectroscopic and light curve analyses.

       "abstract      In this paper, we study theoretically the behavior of a pulse as it\\npropagates through an intracavity fast-light medium. The method of using a\\ntransfer function to determine a pulse after it passes through a cavity is well\\nknown. However, this approach cannot be used to determine the behavior of the\\npulse inside the cavity. To circumvent this constraint, we use an approach that\\nstarts by finding a self-consistent solution for a monochromatic field of\\ninfinite spatial and temporal extents, and determine its amplitudes before,\\ninside, and after the cavity. We then construct a Gaussian input pulse by\\nadding a set of these waves, properly phased and weighted, to represent a\\nmoving pulse before the cavity. Adding these waves at various time intervals\\nthen yields the complete spatial profile everywhere, including before, inside\\nand after the cavity. We first confirm the prediction of this model by\\nanalyzing the behavior of a pulse passing through an empty cavity, and\\ncomparing the prediction of the output with the one produced by the transfer\\nfunction method. We then apply the technique to a cavity containing a\\nfast-light medium. The resulting model allows us to visualize the behavior of\\nthe pulse as it propagates superluminally inside the cavity, and interferes\\nwith itself through multiple bounces. For a vanishing group index, an\\ninterference pattern is formed immediately after the pulse enters the cavity,\\nwith an output pulse emerging with no time delay or distortion. The results\\nobtained here illustrates the physical mechanism behind pulse propagation\\nthrough a white light cavity, a process we have proposed earlier for realizing\\na high bandwidth, long delay data buffering system\\n\n",

    "Above we got the papers in the cluster that had the most papers of the same category as the original paper. This is a bit ham-handed, as having the category itself should be a good enough ground truth approximation, but if we were to use these identified clusterings as a proxy for the category this would demonstrate how well those results reflect the data.\n",

The second result seems like a believable candidate, but overall this approach seems subpar relative to the other content based metrics. As a starting point - it may be helpful for initiating a localized search in a larger dataset.\n",

    "TF-IDF vectorizations can be used to represent large corpuses of data and get basic notions of similarity quickly. Other approaches may augment or improve on this methodology like Doc2Vec, which uses these vectorizations to generate a more dense document vector to calculate similarity more effectively. This relates to other, more novel approaches such as transformers, which seek to train DNN's that encode inter-sentence & intra-sentence context and then apply this broadly capable architecture to more specific problems via transfer learning. Document Clustering provides you with another avenue to understand and analyze text data, projecting documents and their similarity metrics into lower dimensional spaces for different notions of similarity. \n",
